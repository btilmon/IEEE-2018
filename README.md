## Workflow
"cv_pipeline.py" was ran on a Raspberry Pi. The lidar files and "movement.py" were ran on a separate Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi's communicated via serial, fusing camera and lidar data to move autnomously around the course. 

## Hardware
  * Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian Stretch Operating System, quantity = 2
  * Logitech C270 USB Camera
  * Raspberry Pi Cam V2 Camera
  * RPLidar A1 Lidar
