# 2018-2019 IEEE Robot 
For the 2019 IEEE SoutheastCon Hardware Competition, the Murray State University IEEE Robotics Team developed an atuonomous robot, this is the repository containing all code for this project. We placed 12th out of 46 schools.

## Workflow
"cv_pipeline.py" was ran on a Raspberry Pi and the lidar files and "movement.py" were ran on another Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi's communicated via serial, fusing camera and lidar data to move autnomously around the course. 

## Hardware
  * Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian Stretch Operating System, quantity = 2
  * Logitech C270 USB Camera
  * Raspberry Pi Cam V2 Camera
  * RPLidar A1 Lidar
